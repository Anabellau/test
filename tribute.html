  <h3>Nelson Mandela</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1918 Born Rolihlahla Mandela at Mvezo in the Transkei</li>
    <li>925	Attends primary school near Qunu (receives the name ‘Nelson’ from a teacher)</li>
    <li>1930 Father dies. Entrusted to Thembu Regent Jongintaba Dalindyebo at the age of 12 While his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom places Mandela's father’s death in 1927, historical evidence shows it must have been later, most likely 1930. In fact, the original Long Walk to Freedom manuscript (written on Robben Island) states the year as 1930.</li>
    <li>1934 Undergoes initiation; Attends Clarkebury Boarding Institute in Engcobo</li>
    <li>1937 Attends Healdtown, the Wesleyan College at Fort Beaufort</li>
  </ul>
